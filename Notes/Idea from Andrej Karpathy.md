## How to use LLM

### LLM interact

Itâ€™s a iteration chat. Each time you finish your chat or the robot finishes its chat, the power return. And all the tokens shown in the chat log will be previous tokens to predict the tokens in the future. 

For the normal mode, LLM learned knowledge form the pretraining. It only learns the blur knowledge which is loose but can be organized.

### Think mode

It uses reinforce learning to more in complicated process to solve math or code problems.

### Search mode

It search online to get the newest information, and bring all the knowledge back to you and show citation for all different website.

### Deep research mode

it combines the think mode and search mode.



### File load, add document to text

We can submit the content of the book itself to require the LLM to summarize.



### Python interpreter/ Java Interpreter(Advanced data analysis)

It uses data inside the LLM

### Artifact

create a conceptual diagram of this chapter



### Cursor



### Modalities

Audio input(superWhisper, wisprFlow, MacWhisper, etc.)

Audio output(usually within app)

True Audio inside LLM

Podcast generation & interaction(notebookLM)

image input(see, OCR ask about)

see the transcript to see whether the value and words are correct

###  Memory

You can ask Chatgpt to remember, forget, change memory



### Custom GPT
